# Agent Operating Contract

This repo uses named agent roles to keep AI work focused and durable. A single agent can play more than one role, but the active role must be named in handoffs when it affects the work.

Default loop:

`Planner -> Builder -> QA -> Librarian`

The runtime module that builds hub plan snapshots is called the operational planner. It is not the same thing as the AI Planner Agent role.

## Shared Rules

- Read `docs/ai/project-context.md` before substantial work.
- Check `docs/ai/current-state.md` when resuming after a break or handoff.
- Keep changes scoped to the request and existing repo patterns.
- Prefer small, verifiable edits over large speculative rewrites.
- Update durable memory only when project behavior, workflow, architecture, or operational steps have changed.
- Do not preserve vague notes just because they exist. Make memory useful or archive it.

## Planner Agent

Purpose: turn a request into a small, actionable plan.

Use when scope is unclear, multiple implementation paths are plausible, or architecture, deployment, data flow, or risk may change.

Inputs:

- user request
- `docs/ai/project-context.md`
- relevant recent handoffs

Outputs:

- concise plan or implementation checklist
- open questions only when needed
- risks or dependencies worth checking before edits

Memory responsibilities:

- create a decision record if the plan chooses a meaningful architecture, workflow, or deployment direction
- avoid writing handoffs unless the planning work itself leaves durable context

## Builder Agent

Purpose: implement the requested code or documentation change.

Use when scope is clear enough to edit files, a plan has been accepted, or an issue needs a concrete fix.

Inputs:

- current branch and git status
- relevant code paths
- accepted plan or user request
- `AGENTS.md`

Outputs:

- focused code or docs changes
- passing relevant checks where possible
- commit-ready diff

Memory responsibilities:

- update `docs/ai/project-context.md` when stable project behavior changes
- add or update runbooks when operational steps change
- add a handoff for substantial work

## QA Agent

Purpose: verify changes and look for breakage, missing tests, and risky assumptions.

Use when a branch is ready for validation, tests fail or coverage is uncertain, or behavior crosses UI, API, data, or CI boundaries.

Inputs:

- changed files
- existing tests
- relevant runbooks
- expected behavior from the user or docs

Outputs:

- commands and tests run with results
- issues found, ordered by severity
- test gaps or residual risks

Memory responsibilities:

- record recurring failures or debugging discoveries in a handoff or investigation note
- update runbooks if verification steps changed

## Librarian Agent

Purpose: keep the AI memory system accurate, concise, and easy to use.

Use when several agents have worked on the repo, docs feel stale or scattered, or a release, deployment, or architecture change needs memory cleanup.

Inputs:

- `docs/ai/`
- recent handoffs
- recent commits or PRs
- current repo layout

Outputs:

- cleaned or consolidated memory docs
- stale notes identified or corrected
- updated current state

Memory responsibilities:

- keep `docs/ai/current-state.md` short and current
- prune duplication where possible
- preserve useful links and remove vague notes

## Release Manager Agent

Purpose: prepare a branch or set of changes for merge, deployment, or public release.

Use when moving work from development toward production, preparing release notes, or checking readiness before merge.

Inputs:

- git diff or commit range
- test and CI status
- deployment runbooks
- release notes template

Outputs:

- release summary
- validation checklist
- risks and rollback notes

Memory responsibilities:

- update release notes or handoff notes
- add deployment or rollback runbooks once environments exist

## Architecture Reviewer Agent

Purpose: keep the system simple and coherent as it grows.

Use when changes introduce new modules, services, persistence, infrastructure, duplicated behavior, or complexity that feels larger than the problem.

Inputs:

- affected code paths
- `docs/ai/project-context.md`
- decision records

Outputs:

- risks, simplification opportunities, and missing decisions
- recommendations grounded in existing patterns

Memory responsibilities:

- add decision records for accepted architecture choices
- update project context when architecture changes

## Environment and DevOps Agent

Purpose: maintain local setup, CI/CD, deployment, and infrastructure documentation.

Use when dependencies, CI, cloud environments, secrets, deployment flow, Terraform, hosting, or dev/prod behavior changes.

Inputs:

- `package.json`
- `.github/workflows/`
- deployment files
- runbooks
- environment setup notes

Outputs:

- updated CI or setup docs
- runbook changes
- risk notes for secrets, deploys, and rollback

Memory responsibilities:

- keep runbooks current
- update `docs/ai/project-context.md` for CI/CD or deployment changes
- add decision records for branch strategy, deployment model, or infrastructure choices
